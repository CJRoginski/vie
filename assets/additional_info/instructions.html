					In this amazing online board game, you will be tested upon various different topics regarding the club Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) as well as many topics that are taught in high school business classes. Not only will this be presented in question format, but in the gameplay as well, like deciding whether or not to buy an asset or upgrade another.
				</p>
				<p>
					And it's up to your knowledge and decisions to make your business far better than that of your rival player(s).

				<p>
					In the beginning, all players will start at <strong>GO</strong>. You will then "roll" two dice and move the appropriate number of spaces. To roll the dice, click on one of the two die in the upper left hand corner.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					If you do not land on a corner space, you will be required to answer a question regarding FBLA or other business-related topics. Answer the question correctly, and you will be rewarded; answer incorrectly, and pay the price.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="right">
				<p>
					The amount to which you gain or loose answering a question is dependent on the question's difficultly, the rent of the space you landed on, and who owns the space. Here's a basic table for reference (take a screenshot of it, if you need, for future reference):

					If you land on <strong>Holiday</strong>, then congratulations! This free space provides you a quick break from the busy life of the business world!
				</p>
				<p>
					If you land on <strong>JAIL</strong>, don't worry! You're not the one in jail. In fact, you're just visiting.
				</p>
				<p style="margin-bottom:3px;">
					If you land on or pass <strong>GO</strong>, you will automatically earn a fixed amount of money. The amount is dependent on the current difficultly of the questions.
				</p>
					<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
						<li><strong>Easy:</strong> +$400</li>
						<li><strong>Medium:</strong> +$200</li>
						<li><strong>Hard:</strong> +$100</li>
					</ul>

			<div class="right">
				<p style="margin-bottom:2px;">
					If you land on the <strong>Go to JAIL</strong> corner or end up rolling three sets of doubles in a row, then you're in some serious trouble with the law. Thankfully, your sentence isn't that long&mdash;at most, three of your turns&mdash;but there are several, "legal", ways to get out of jail before your full sentence is over:
				</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Roll doubles.</li>
						<li>Pay a fine of $50 before rolling.</li>
					</ul>
				<p style="margin-top:4px;">
					If you "choose" to serve out your full three-turn sentence, then you must pay $50 after rolling your dice. However, once out of <strong>JAIL</strong>, you will move to <strong>Just Visiting</strong> for the remainder of your turn.
					<br>
					Even though you may be in jail, you can still manage your business assets and collect rent from Fortune, so good things and bad.

					If you land on a space that no one owns, you will be given the chance to buy that asset after answering your question. Assets are meant to benefit you and your business, and give you an edge over your rivals.
				</p>
				<p>
					You cannot, however, sell your assets or attempt to buy any properties that other players do not buy. You also cannot upgrade any of your Advertising assets, as their rents increase with the amount of Advertising assets that you own.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="right">
				<p>
					If you own all of the properties of a certain color, you will be able to upgrade those assets, which will greatly increase the rent of those spaces.
				</p>
				<p>
					To upgrade, you must click on the asset card that you want to upgrade before you roll your dice.

				<p>
					However, if you reach the end of the game with all of the possible questions answered and neither you nor your rival(s) have gone bankrupt, your business's total worth will be calculated and will then be compared to their calculated total worth. Whomever has the highest worth will win this chapter of your rivalry!
